Here's a clear and well-organized explanation of the steps:

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to each of the three project directories and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Add Changes to Git:

After making changes to the files, ensure that all modifications are added to version control by running:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Start the Application:

To launch the application, execute the following command in each of the three project directories:
bash
Copy code
npm run start
Testing the Application:

Once the application is running, open multiple tabs in your browser and access the app at localhost.
Sign in with different accounts across the tabs to simulate real-time chatting.
This setup allows you to interact with the app simultaneously across multiple sessions, testing real-time chat functionality.
This process ensures that the application is correctly set up, running, and ready for real-time communication testing.
