ðŸš€ Getting Your Application Up and Running Locally
1. Install Dependencies ðŸ“¦
Ensure all necessary packages are installed in each of your project directories by executing npm install.
2. Stage Changes for Commit ðŸ“‚
If you've made any updates or modifications, make sure they are tracked by version control. Use git add . in each directory to stage all changes.
3. Start the Application ðŸš€
Fire up your application in each directory by running npm run start. This will launch the app and make it accessible on localhost.
4. Test Real-Time Chatting ðŸ’¬
Open multiple browser tabs, each pointing to localhost.
Sign in with different accounts across these tabs to experience and test the real-time chatting feature.
You can now interact with the app simultaneously across different sessions and see how the chat works in real time.
