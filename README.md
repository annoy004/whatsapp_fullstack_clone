To run the application locally and test the real-time chatting functionality, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies:

In each of the three project directories, ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed by running the npm install command.
Stage Changes for Commit:

After making any updates or modifications to the project files, add these changes to version control using the git add . command.
Start the Application:

Launch the application in each project directory by running the npm run start command.
Test Real-Time Chatting:

Open your browser and navigate to localhost to access the application.
Sign in with multiple accounts using different tabs, all pointing to the same localhost address.
This setup will allow you to view the application and test the real-time chatting functionality across multiple sessions simultaneously.
